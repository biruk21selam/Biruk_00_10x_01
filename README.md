Solar Radiation Analysis for MoonLight Energy Solutions
This repository contains the code and analysis for a project aimed at identifying high-potential regions for solar installations to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability at MoonLight Energy Solutions.

Project Goals:

Analyze solar radiation data (GHI, DNI, DHI, temperature, wind, etc.).
Identify key trends, correlations, and relationships within the data.
Develop a data-driven strategy for selecting optimal locations for solar installations.
Support data-driven decision-making within the organization..
Key Activities:

Data Exploration & Cleaning: Loading, inspecting, and cleaning the solar radiation dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing statistical analysis, generating summary statistics, and visualizing data distributions.
Time Series Analysis: Analyzing temporal trends in solar radiation and weather patterns.
Correlation Analysis: Investigating relationships between solar radiation, temperature, wind, and other factors.
Site Selection Analysis: Identifying potential locations based on solar resource availability and other relevant criteria.
Technologies & Tools:

Python
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
